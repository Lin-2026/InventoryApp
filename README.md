This is a simple inventory app using Python that detects barcode scanner inputs

Really simple to run, download the .py file and run open it with a python IDE. 

This app offers log in and sign up options and allows for admins to add or remove items. As of right now, the user can only add items but not remove items for their own shopping cart. This will be added in future updated.
